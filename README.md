# TheDinoKing.com Website
## The GitHub project of my casual website 

  Used to clone & run the latest stable release online, along with keeping track of progress on the site

  There are also experimental branches for rewriting the site to make it more efficient, consolidate functionality, add new features, or fix inconsistency overall compared to the stable branch

### Note for Lore Hunters: 
  Please do not use this as a cheat sheet to gain knowledge of secrets & easter eggs in a way you weren't supposed to. :(
