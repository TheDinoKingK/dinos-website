# Dinos-Website
The GitHub project of my website 
Used to clone & run the latest stable release online, along with keeping track of progress on the site.
Not only that, there are experimental branches for rewriting the site to make it _more_ efficient, add new features, or fix inconsistency overall compared to the stable branch.
_and_ you can look at my messy code and criticize my logic! how exciting! :D
